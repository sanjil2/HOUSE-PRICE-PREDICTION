# House-Price-Prediction



The relationship between house prices and the economy is an important motivating factor for 
predicting house prices. A propertyâ€™s value is important in real estate transactions. 
Housing price trends are not only the concern of buyers and sellers, but it also indicates 
the current economic situation. Therefore, it is important to predict housing prices without
bias to help both the buyers and sellers make their decisions. In this project, we are going 
to create a website where user have to add some property details for predicting the house price, 
enter date for forecasting the price till that date and budget range for recommending best location.
This project uses two datasets, one includes some features and large entries of housing sales 
in Mumbai and another contains house price index of Mumbai. We are using different feature 
selection methods and feature extraction method with Multiple Linear Regression to predict 
the current house price and using ARIMA model for forecasting the price after few years in 
Mumbai and also uses content based recommendation system to recommend best location according 
to their budget in nearby area of interest.
